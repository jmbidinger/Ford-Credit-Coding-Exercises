# Ford-Credit-Coding-Exercises
This is my code for the 2021 Software Engineering Internship Program at Ford Motor Credit Company. Though only one of the two exercises was required, I have included solutions to both so that you may select your choice of these two programs for evaluation, or evaluate both of them if you wish.

These programs were both written in C. I have included a Makefile in order to compile these C files using a gcc compiler. Once compiled, each program can be run from the terminal by prepending the name of the executable with "./" (e.g. enter ./manhattanDistance to run my code for the Manhattan Distance exercise).
